**Similar Flowers**

The unfinished project.   

Problems I have faced are versioning Jupyter notebooks and unsupported CUDA by the host device (and some unexpected issues specific for Windows that were mostly resolved), therefore:  

The Jupyter notebook similar_flowers.ipynb (in the first initial commit) shows an example of finding similar images with a pretrained model.  

The Jupyter notebook similar_flowers_train.ipynb shows a process of training the model (the training process is not finished due to CUDA unavailability in the host, but it takes into account how it could be done with it).
